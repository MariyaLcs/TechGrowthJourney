# TechGrowthJourney

This repository documents my ongoing journey of learning and growth in the tech industry, featuring yearly statistics, reflections, and key learning resources

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository dedicated to the personal statistics of learning and professional development in the IT industry.

Seven years ago, after moving to England, I faced a decisive moment in my career and life - transitioning from mechanical engineering to the world of information technology. This step was not just the beginning of a new professional path but also a journey into the depths of self-development and continuous learning.

The transition into IT was marked by promises of becoming a professional quickly through various courses and training programs. However, it soon became clear that success was backed not only by hours of coding and project work but also by countless hours of study, self-education, and practice.

My story is a narrative about the importance of a mindful approach to learning and development, accounting for every hour spent, and tracking progress. I started to keep track of my learning about 5 years ago to better understand how much time is spent achieving professional goals and mastery.

Here, in this repository, I want to share my experience, statistics, and lessons learned over the years. This place is for those seeking inspiration and understanding that professional growth in IT is supported not only by talent but also by hard work, time, and a continuous quest for knowledge.
